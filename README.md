# Home Automation FAQ for non-hackers or how a hobby can turn into a non-paid job

I was so frustrated after the initial week of automating my home that decided to summarize my frustration in this list of advices for new automators out there. Hope it saves you some time. 

When stepping on the home automation path keep in mind that like with any other home improvement project, measurable benefits from automation are negligible in most scenarios. If you enjoy fiddling with new technology, it can become your new cool hobby, just don't expect miracles from it. You can make your house more comfortable, safe and secure via automation, but don't think about it in terms of this picture:

Most of the automation is not about saving time, it's about saving hassle of opening garage doors, adding comfort to your evening routine and smooting out little frustration moments in our daily lives when someone opens a window with the a/c on (overnight)... you can easily and cheaply automate scenarios like these. And you'd enjoy this process more if you know about the pitfalls in advance. Hence this FAQ.

## The things I wish I knew before diving into HomeKit Automation

1. Early accept necessity of hubs / gateways. Most devices on the market require them to function properly, and  if you're lucky to have a large enough house with solid walls, each room would also require [something to act as a repeater](https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/m7wktp/what_are_some_useful_zigbee_repeaters/), as low-energy protocols such as BLE / Zigbee / ZWave do not penetrate walls as good as Wi-Fi (which you probably should not be using anyway, see #3). Oh, and, by the way, hubs from different manufacturers, even when using same communication "standard", more often than not would not work with each other w/o some extensive footwork. So yeah, different hubs for different brands unless you're ready for open source path (see #4).

2. Whenever you have a choice, stick to Gizbee-based devices. Easier to setup, more reliable and less maintanance in the long run. Not sure what Gizbee is? Google "[Gizbee BLE mesh vs Wi-Fi](https://www.google.com/search?q=Gizbee+BLE+mesh+vs+Wi-Fi)". Sometimes you'd have a BLE device -- make sure you set it up to communicate via a hub and not directly with your phone, as *none* of your automations will work reliably (or at all) w/o such hub (or gateway, same-same). In other words, do not allow your "smart app" to use Bluetooth after you paired a device to the hub or/and Homebridge: Settings -> [app name] -> Bluetooth OFF.

3. In the beginning avoid buying Wi-Fi-based devices, unless you want to spend some days and $$$ re-configuring your entire wireles home network. Or the other way around: dive right into it and get couple of Wi-Fi devices first, methodically go thru all the setup troubles with them instead of fixing things with a dozen of quirky gadgets when you're cannot be certain whether it's your network's or one of the device's fault. Wi-Fi was not designed for IoT and while people new to this expect everything to "just work" since they already have a Wi-Fi router and it works fine for their phones and PCs. Actually it's 100% opposite, since most of "smart" devices built with quite dumb chips and if your home network is anything less than perfect it is pretty much guaranteed to give you hours of frustration with the same outcome: it won't work reliably (if at all) until you get rid of cheap / old routers, split (rename) your 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks, juggle with channels, struggle with interference, turn off MIMO/beamforming, tinker with bridges, DHCP and static IP-addresses, re-configure or disable repeaters, give up, weep helplessly, switch to Wi-Fi 6 etc etc. The easier, newer and more uniform your Wi-Fi setup is the better it is for home automation, period ([more info](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeKit/comments/bi0bp1/no_response_a_constant_irritation_with_homekit/)). If, however, you're 100% certain that your Wi-Fi network is up to fickle IoT requirements, Wi-Fi based devices should not be a problem most of the time.

4. If using Homekit it is absolutely recommended to install and get used to Homebridge as early as possible. Steep, but short learning curve will save you lots of trouble down the way and you won't have to re-configure everything from scratch when you inevitably decide to adopt Homebridge. This means you have to get either a [Raspberry](https://www.reddit.com/r/homebridge/comments/dlct5d/homebridge_experience_with_raspberry_pi_zero_wh/) or [HOOBS](https://hoobs.com/) or [athom](https://www.aliexpress.com/wholesale?trafficChannel=main&d=y&CatId=0&SearchText=athom+homekit&ltype=wholesale&SortType=price_desc&page=1&groupsort=1) or a similar device, even better with Zigbee and Bluetooth modules attached (note: there's also [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/), but I'm happy with HomeKit). In my opinion, HomeKit is the superior, more realiable and tightly integrated way to control your home. You can automate 87% of common scenarios right within the app __and__ access them from your Control Center or Siri w/o resorting to Shortcuts or any other "smartish" intermediaries. For non-tech members of the family this is ~100x times better than remembering which app controls living room curtains and which is for kitchen a/c unit. Also, granting or revoking your HomeKit access to guests or relatives takes about 8 seconds and requires no training. 

In case you need more advanced scenarios that would require something like launching a sophisticated shortcut via a sensor trigger  ([not possible as of right now](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/650702)), look into something like [HomeAssistant + Node-RED](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/home-assistant-community-add-on-node-red/55023), or just admit that some bizarre ideas like Alexa [telling **you** to open a window](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/node-red-flow-examples/83644/31) or dynamic wake-up alarms based on your tomorrow's schedule not worth your time and go surfing with your kid instead. 

HomeKit _looks_ underpowered out-of-the-box but it is simply because Apple-as-usual tries to hide lots of functionality behind as few interface elements as possible to make it more accessible for technology-challenged majority of users. If you consider other Apple stock software, HomeKit actually stands out as well designed and tested. Of course [Apple keeps "making things better"](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeKit/comments/lmhztb/homekit_in_control_center_is_so_bad/), i.e. [wrong-guessing users' intentions](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeKit/comments/hhimll/the_ios_14_control_center_automatically_shows/) or moving panels around every flicking time with each iOS update, so all your habits are broken annually, but that's true about every app out there that keeps UI designers on payroll after the initial rollout. Some people while being in iOS-ecosystem still prefer (re)branded framework-based "smart apps", and I am not sure why. These apps might be useful for initial device pairing (as sometimes there's no way around it), but then you forget about them as soon as everything works smoothly with Homebridge and HomeKit. If you keep using different apps for different devices then one day after a long holiday trip you'll forget how to control your own home, so keeping everything inside HomeKit is the way to go, imho.

5. Having said that, from UX/reliability standpoint "Works with HomeKit" label means almost nothing at this point + you almost always will need a hub to connect devices from various manufacturers to your HomeKit. Very few accessories are trouble-free despite having a HomeKit logo on them ([example](https://www.reddit.com/r/tradfri/comments/lqgf3a/using_tradfri_motion_sensors_with_homekit/)). Use Homebridge to connect everything to HomeKit and before buying something new always check if there's a plugin for your device, not just particular brand -- __the particular device__ you have in mind ([see how it works](https://github.com/dresden-elektronik/deconz-rest-plugin/wiki/Supported-Devices))! Otherwise you'll end up with a crazy zoo of Chinese re-skinned "smart apps" controlling their own set of devices, each of them requiring a separate account, "calling home" all the time etc. There is no guaranteed method to figure out whether something would work with your setup or not, but a sensible way is to buy one device (i.e. sensor, lamp, IR blaster, switch..), test it, make sure it works reliably and then buy 10 more of exact same model or how many you need for your house. I've read people "investing" $1000 in LiFX bulbs and _then_ trying to set them all up, which is a special kind of masochism.

6. HomeKit itself is one big can of ~~worms~~ bugs. To make your ~~debugging~~ life easier, better enable Location Services for Home **and** for HomeKit on *all* household iPhones and iPads: Settings -> Privacy -> Location services -> enable for Home, .. -> System Services -> enable for HomeKit. Also, if you plan on using HomePods ~~[brace yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeKit/search/?q=homepod&restrict_sr=1&sr_nsfw=)~~ keep in mind there will be NO way to prevent them from becoming hubs for *all* your Home automation (unless you downgrade them to mere Bluetooth speakers where they do belong to be perfectly honest). This (HomePod being a Home hub) means your Wi-Fi has to be rock-solid (but 5 GHz networks are fine in this particular case) and make sure you enable Personal requests in HomePod settings: Home -> long tap on HomePod -> scroll aaaaallll the way down and look for Personal requests. If you cannot see them, try iPad / iPhone that was used to set up the Homepod in question. Lastly, [disable "Private address"](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeKit/comments/pp42bg/im_90_sure_private_address_in_wifi_setting_is/) in your Wi-Fi settings. These tricks will alleviate *some* of Siri's dumbness when it comes to locations, presence-based automations and requests by different people. Why Siri is so [mind-bogginly stupid](https://www.reddit.com/r/SiriFail/top/?t=all) in other 95% of cases is still a mystery. And a topic for different FAQ.

7. Homebridge being community driven is also far from perfect, i.e. multiple plugins for the same purpose, only one of which *probably* works, and you'd have to solve this riddle the hard way by trying and debugging all of them ([example](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=tuya%20homebridge)), so have your expectations in check, but at least it gives you a very good degree of control, especially if you enjoy tinkering with open source. Principle advice: enable debug logging and never turn it off. It will save you hours trying to figure out why something does not connect or stopped working despite lack of error messages. 

8. Forget about using YouTube for research prior to buying new gadgets, it's almost always only unboxing / comparing models / testing basic features and never about real problems you'll face with your bright new colored bulb that drops off the network, gives you zero diagnostic information about what had happened and requires 15 minutes to be readded back ([case in point](https://forum.yeelight.com/search?q=available), [another one](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifx/search/?q=connection&restrict_sr=1)). And now imagine you have 20 of these things, each one acting wacky following their own biorhythm. At this point home automation becames your 2nd job you hate, not your hobby. 
Extensively search Reddit, Github and negative Amazon reviews to estimate amount of headache coming with each new device. This is true about each and every brand out there even for seemignly simpliest devices such as switches, sensors or lamps ([exhibit 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Hue/search/?q=disconnected&restrict_sr=1)). Pardon my prejudice, but seems like the problems stem from Chinese origin of most of the hardware and (especially!) software: full of bugs that will never be fixed, terrible UI/UX and non-existent English supprt. Best known brands such as Phillips, IKEA are more reliable ([not entirely perfect though](https://www.reddit.com/r/tradfri/comments/di7h18/ikea_motion_sensor_designed_to_fail/)), but they offer a limited range of products, so at some point you'd have to bite the bullet and resort to AliExpress, buying cats in bags.

The good thing is once you get "hearth" of your automation set up and properly configured, adding each new device takes less and less time, so all your initial pains fade away and you begin enjoying automating everything around you. Automation scenarios keep popping up in your mind, you keep shopping for new stuff and adding something to your home almost on a daily basis. And here comes the last point: 

99. Remember to ask yourself "Should I do it?" instead of "Can I do it?" Yes, you __probably__ can control your TV from your phone, but do you really need it if there's a purposefully designed remote nearby that requires zero setup and maintenance and works reliably 99.9% of the time? Or "smart kettles"... Sounds like a bad joke, but there are alive humans out there who actually buy this stuff and encourage manufacturers to churn out these ridiculous products without giving any thought to why they are needed in the first place (apart, of course, from making money and destroying this planet).

## It is still a magical feeling when you come out of the shower and Siri has closed the curtains, dimmed the lights, adjusted the aircon, turned on the projector and the soundsystem for an evening movie session. So good luck chasing your dreams! Most people in this world can't even dream about it.
